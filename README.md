# Documentation

## Overview

The **Study Guide Helper** is a sophisticated educational tool designed to aid in study and learning processes. It integrates advanced text processing, OpenAI's GPT-4, and a user-friendly interface to provide targeted learning support. This document provides detailed information on using and understanding the software implementation.

## How to Use the Software

### Installation and Setup

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure that all required libraries are installed. This can be done using pip:
   ```
   pip install pdfplumber pytesseract PyPDF2 nltk sklearn openai
   ```

2. **API Key**: To use OpenAI's GPT-4, you need an API key. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable or modify the `query_gpt4` function to include your key.

3. **Data Preparation**: Before using the application, ensure all lecture transcripts, textbook chapters, and overview files are stored in their respective directories.

### Running the Application

1. **Text Extraction and Processing**: Run the script sections from "Step 1" to "Step 3" to preprocess and set up your corpus of texts.
2. **Parallelized Query Processing with GPT-4 (Step 4)**: This step involves using GPT-4 in conjunction with a context-based retrieval system for answering guiding questions.
3. **Generating Guiding Questions and Key Concepts (Step 5)**: Automatically generate guiding questions and key concepts for lectures.
4. **User Interaction (Step 6)**: Execute this section for the main program loop, which allows users to query the system or get guided questions.

### User Options

- **Get Guiding Questions**: Input a week number to retrieve guiding questions for that week.
- **Ask a Question**: Submit a query to get answers generated by GPT-4 based on the educational materials.
- **Quit**: Exit the application.

## Software Implementation

### Module Description

#### Text Processing

- **PDF Extraction**: `extract_text_from_pdf` function extracts text from PDF files.
- **Text Chunking**: `chunk_text_by_chapter_and_save` divides text into chapters or sections.

#### AI Integration

- **GPT-4 Queries**: `query_gpt4` sends prompts to GPT-4 and retrieves AI-generated responses.
- **Contextual Query Processing**: The application uses lecture transcripts and textbook content as context for GPT-4 queries.

#### Parallelized Query Processing with GPT-4 (Step 4)

- **Efficient Answering Mechanism**: Using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallel processing of queries.
- **Dynamic Context Integration**: Combines GPT-4 queries with relevant contextual documents for accurate responses.

#### Generating Guiding Questions and Key Concepts (Step 5)

- **Automated Generation**: Utilizes GPT-4 to automatically generate guiding questions and key concepts from lecture transcripts.
- **Parsing and Formatting**: Implements regular expressions for parsing and formatting generated content.

#### User Interface

- **Menu System**: The `display_menu` function provides an interactive menu to the users.
- **Guiding Questions Retrieval**: Users can retrieve guiding questions based on the week of their course.
- **Dynamic Query Processing**: The `ask_question` function allows users to get answers to their queries using GPT-4.

### Code Structure

- **Organization**: The code is organized into distinct sections, each handling different aspects of the application: text processing, file verification, AI integration, and user interaction.
- **Modularity**: Functions are designed to perform specific tasks, making the codebase modular and easy to maintain.

### Error Handling

- Error handling is implemented throughout the application to ensure robustness, especially in file operations and API interactions.

## Conclusion

The **Study Guide Helper** is a comprehensive tool designed for educational purposes. Its implementation showcases the integration of advanced text processing techniques and AI to facilitate learning. This documentation provides a basic guide to using and understanding the software.
